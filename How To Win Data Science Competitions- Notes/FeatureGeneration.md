<h1 align="center"> Feature Generation</h1>
 Feature generation is a process of creating new features using knowledge about the features and the task. It helps us by making model training more simple and effective. Sometimes, we can engineer these features using prior knowledge and logic. Sometimes we have to dig into the data, create and check hypothesis, and use this derived knowledge and our intuition to derive new features.
