# [Wonderful Tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-convolutions-for-deep-learning-1f6f42faee1) to learn CNN 
# [this](https://medium.com/@dataturks/deep-learning-and-computer-vision-from-basic-implementation-to-efficient-methods-3ca994d50e90) tutorial is one of the best for reviewing CNN and use it in practice 

## Useful Insights of this tutorial
### Batch Normalization
Batch normalization normalizes the output of a previous activation layer by substracting the batch mean & dividing it by the batch standard deviation

### Transfer Learning
When we have very few data as train set we use transfer learning. In this process we use pretrained weights and train the last few layers for our dataset.

### Weight Initialization
When using RELU as activation using **Xavier Initialization** is a good move.

### Training Time
Keras and PyTorch is simple but pretty slow. So, using Tensorflow is a good choice.
